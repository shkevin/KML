About The Project
=================

The KML tool was developed for streaming/online machine learning (ML), and is
implemented in C++11 and Python. The core framework was developed in C++
in order to achieve high performance, while Python is exposed through
Cython compilation. Python was used in order to be easily adopted by
other researchers, data scientists, or machine learning engineers.

Why KML?
==========

* A readable and user-friendly API for engineers/scientists.
* Exhaustive user documentation.
* C++/Python users and developers should feel at home.
* Exhaustive test coverage.
* MIT licensed and free for all purposes.

Anaconda Installation
=====================

Whether youâ€™re new to Python or an old hand, we highly recommend installing
`Anaconda <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`_. Anaconda conveniently
installs Python and other commonly used packages for scientific computing and
data science in your home directory, including all of KML's dependencies.

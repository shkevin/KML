^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Fork the project on `GitHub <https://github.com/shkevin/KML>`_.

#. Create or comment on the issue letting everyone know you're going to be working on it so that nobody duplicates your effort.
#. Write the documentation. Documentation files live in the `docs` directory and are in Restructured Text Format.
#. Once your contribution is complete, submit a pull request on GitHub.
#. Wait for it to either be merged by a maintainer or to receive feedback about what needs to be revised.

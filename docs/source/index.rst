Welcome!
========

The KML tool was developed for streaming machine/online learning (ML), and is
implemented in C++11 and Python. The core framework was developed in C++
in order to achieve high performance, while Python is exposed through
Cython compilation. Python was used in order to be easily adopted by
other researchers, data scientists, or machine learning engineers.

This tool can be adopted by users from either C++ or Python. The framework
can be written in either language. This is intended to help the community that requires
performance as well as the community that desires ease of use and flexibility.

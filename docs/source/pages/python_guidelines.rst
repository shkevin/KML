Cython/Python Guidelines
========================

Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following rules present basic guidelines for the KML Cython/Python code. These guidelines may
evolve in time so it is first good practice to check them upon creation of a new package or code refactoring.

Standard
~~~~~~~~

- Files should be named as closely to their C++ counterpart as possible, while still following `PEP8 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_ guidelines.

Python Version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The python version should follow the required python in the project README. This is listed in
`README <README.html>`_
